# Machines 

All machines need maintenance.

The degradation is in a weibull-curve-fashion over 
time until they reach the end of their life.

They can be fixed along the way, but with 
each fix the overall lifetime prolonging is 
reduced exponentially, until it is no longer 
cost-effective to maintain.

The machines need skills, that need to be bought
or be provided by the city.

The machines have a level of complexity, that 
can increase or decrease, based on the available
resources and the available skills.

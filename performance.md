# Performance

For Developing, Testing and small cities php is good enough. 

Later on, we write a PHP-To-C++-Compiler with hard constraints,
so it is not too hard.
 -> Everything is typed
 -> Only a small number of functions are allowed
 -> Attributes are used for typed comments
 -> We can use the PHP-Classes themself to introspect themselves
 -> Strict import structures 
 -> no aliasing of functions or classes
 -> no dynamic function calls (except in a few special cases)
